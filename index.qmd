## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you should be able to:

- Identify appropriate experimental techniques that can be applied to solving specific biological questions

- Design experiments including the selection of appropriate controls 



## Consider how the tools at your disposal can be applied to answering biological questions

- Use appropriate techniques to study a problem/question of interest (understand the technique + its limitations)

- Include appropriate controls

- Biological context, environmental conditions, & experimental set-up **matter**

## What are the tools at your disposal?

- Your brain (think critically)

- The scientific literature (what is already known)

- Toolkit: known and already developed techniques 
- Data analysis techniques (how are you going to analyse & interpret your results?)

## As an illustration, we will work through an example: 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
We have a novel strain of Escherichia coli that appears to be quite virulent

![](images/Ecoli.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Its genome encodes a protein predicted to be a novel transcription factor, VirA

![](images/2RGY.jpg)
:::

::::

## <span style="color:#B22222">Hypothesis: VirA regulates virulence gene expression in this *E. coli* strain</span> 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
We have a novel strain of Escherichia coli that appears to be quite virulent

![](images/Ecoli.jpg)
:::

::::

## <span style="color:#B22222">Hypothesis: VirA regulates virulence gene expression in this *E. coli* strain</span> 

How can we test this hypothesis? What experiment(s) would you like to do? ^[assuming unlimited resources and funding]

## Genetics approach – how would you create mutant strain(s) for analysing the role of VirA in your strain? (deletion, overexpression, other mutants?) {#genetics}

- What method would you use? 
- What controls are necessary?
- What are the advantages/limitations of this approach?

::: {.notes}
Caveats/limitations mostly centre around possibility of inadvertently introducing off-target mutations/suppressor mutations/mutations that have polar effects on downstream genes, etc. 

Controls: Complement mutants, include empty vector controls (when complementing or over-expressing); keep in mind the usual caveats for gene dosage, position, the usual concerns. 
:::

## Biochemistry approach - how would you isolate and purify the VirA protein if you wanted to study it <i>in vitro</i>? {#biochem}

- What method would you use? 
- What controls are necessary?
- What are the advantages/limitations of this approach?

::: {.notes}
Caveats/limitations for biochemical approaches mostly centre around the fact that proteins do not necessarily behave the same way *in vitro* as they do *in vivo*

Specific concerns about purified proteins: did you have to tag it to purify, does the tag affect structure/function, is the protein identical to the protein *in vivo* (are you missing any PTMs, interacting partners, etc.)
:::

## Some specific questions we might want to answer about VirA function & role in virulence {#home}

[What are the phenotype(s) of a *virA* mutant strain?](#phenotypes)

[What DNA sequences does VirA bind?](#DNAbinding)

[What gene(s) does VirA regulate?](#regulon)

[When and to what extent is VirA expressed in the cell?](#expression)

[What protein(s) does VirA interact with?](#interaction)

[What regulates VirA?](#regulation)

## What are the phenotypes of a <i>virA</i> mutant strain? {#phenotypes}

- What method(s) would you use to study *virA* mutant phenotypes? 
- What controls are necessary?
- Can you predict what the results of this experiment might look like, and how would you analyse & interpret the data?
- What are the advantages/limitations of this approach?
- <span style="font-size:0.8em;">For any experiments involving animals, what is required in terms of ethics?</span>

::: aside
[Choose another experiment](#home)
:::

::: {.notes}
Can discuss infection assays and model systems here, but plenty of other potentially interesting phenotypes to discuss here, e.g.:

- biofilm formation assay
- effector protein secretion/virulence protein production
- motility, quorum sensing, other virulence-related phenotypes
:::

## What DNA sequences does VirA bind? {#DNAbinding}

- What method would you use to determine what DNA sequences VirA binds to? 
- What controls are necessary?
- Can you predict what the results of this experiment might look like, and how would you analyse & interpret the data?
- What are the advantages/limitations of this approach?

::: aside
[Choose another experiment](#home)
:::

::: {.notes}
Methods here could include:

- EMSA
- ChIP-seq or ChIP-exo
- DNA footprinting

Consider the advantages/limitations of each (e.g., does *in vitro* binding relate to what happens *in vivo*?)

Consider, does DNA binding involve a small molecule or contact with other proteins? How would you go about experimentally identifying a VirA ligand?
:::

## What gene(s) does VirA regulate? {#regulon}

- What method would you use to identify the VirA regulon? 
- What controls are necessary?
- Can you predict what the results of this experiment might look like, and how would you analyse & interpret the data?
- What are the advantages/limitations of this approach?

::: aside
[Choose another experiment](#home)
:::

::: {.notes}
Methods here might include:

- RNA-seq, microarray, or other way of assaying levels of potential target genes, e.g. in wild-type vs *virA* mutant strains (remember to complement the mutant strain)
- bioinformatic approaches to identify candidate VirA binding sites (based on previous knowledge of where it binds)
- If defining a regulon, remember caveats such as the effects of medium and environmental conditions on what is actually being transcribed in the cell; e.g., if assaying in LB, might not observe much if VirA regulon not normally expressed under those conditions (remember, for *in vivo* experiments with animals - ethics!)
:::

## When and to what extent is VirA expressed in the cell? {#expression}

- What method would you use to measure expression of VirA?
- What controls are necessary?
- Can you predict what the results of this experiment might look like, and how would you analyse & interpret the data?
- What are the advantages/limitations of this approach?

::: aside
[Choose another experiment](#home)

::: {.notes}
Methods here might include:

- looking at mRNA levels (Northern, q-RT-PCR, microarray, RNA-seq)
- looking at protein levels (Western blot or similar)
- using reporter genes (transcriptional or translational)
- If looking at expression remember caveats such as the effects of medium and environmental conditions; e.g., if assaying in LB, might not observe much if VirA not normally expressed under those conditions (remember, for *in vivo* experiments with animals - ethics!)
:::


## What protein(s) does VirA interact with? {#interaction}

- How would you identify/validate potential VirA-interacting proteins?

::: aside
[Choose another experiment](#home)
:::

::: {.notes}
Methods here might include:

- co-IP, BACTH, various biophysical assays...
- keep in mind that each has limitations & would normally expect to see multiple lines of evidence to confirm protein-protein interactions...
:::

## What regulates VirA? {#regulation}

- How would you identify/validate potential regulators of VirA?
- What controls are necessary?
- Can you predict what the results of this experiment might look like, and how would you analyse & interpret the data?

::: aside
[Choose another experiment](#home)
:::

::: {.notes}
Methods here might include:

- screen for regulators using a reporter (e.g., beta-galactosidase) and a Tn library (will never isolate mutants in essential genes, amongst other caveats)
- candidate-based approach (look at VirA expression in known mutant strains)
- identify small molecules or proteins that bind VirA (how?)

# Challenge

Imagine that the BBSRC have given you 2 million pounds over the next 3 years to study the role of VirA in virulence in this new *E. coli*  strain. 

What experiments would you prioritise? Can you make a flow chart and/or Gantt chart illustrating what you would do?
